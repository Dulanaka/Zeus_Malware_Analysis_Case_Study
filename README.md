# Zeus_Malware_Analysis_Case_Study
Since 2006, the Zeus Malware has become the most popular banking trojan, infecting tens of  millions of machines. The malware is distributed as a toolkit, which allows hackers to modify  the source code and create their own variants. Once infected, the Zeus malware can  automatically collect passwords from Protected Storage and potentially take control of your  computer, downloading files, shutting it down, rebooting, or deleting system files, resulting  in your machine crashing. However, hackers frequently use it to monitor selected websites,  insert fields that were not there originally, and steal personal information. For instance, in  addition to your username and password, you may be asked for your phone number, date of  birth, and other personally identifiable information, which could potentially result in account  theft. During the attempt to face certain vulnerabilities, In malware investigation, reverse  engineering has become a standard technique. Throughout this area, reverse engineering is  utilized to understand virus behavior by reproducing and examining the components of the  source code. This method has been utilized in Malware Analysis utilizing Static and Dynamic  approaches, which both heavily rely on Reverse Engineering techniques. Considering the importance of this issue, this case study will focus on the ZeusVM Version  2.0.0.0 trojan, and a complete version of its Toolkit was released for free on the internet,  allowing anybody to construct a Zbot. This study resulted in the discovery of a unique approach for decrypting the URL of the  Command &amp; Control Server. Additionally, the function of certain indexes in RC4 decryption  was revealed, as was the method utilized to encrypt communication between the Command  &amp; Control Server and the client.
